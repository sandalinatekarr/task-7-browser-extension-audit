# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

## Objective
To understand how to identify potentially harmful browser extensions, review their permissions, and remove unnecessary or suspicious ones to improve security and performance.

## Tools Used
- Google Chrome (Version: [Your Version])
- Built-in Chrome Extensions Manager (`chrome://extensions/`)
- Chrome Web Store for reviewing extension ratings and publisher information

## Steps Performed
1. **Opened Extensions Manager**  
   Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` in Google Chrome.
   
2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions**  
   Checked all extensions for:
   - Publisher name
   - Description and purpose
   - Permissions granted
   - User reviews and ratings from the Chrome Web Store

3. **Identified Safe and Suspicious Extensions**  
   - Only **Google Docs Offline** was installed.
   - Verified as safe because it is developed by Google LLC and only requests necessary permissions to work offline.

4. **Decision on Removal or Keeping**  
   - No suspicious extensions found.
   - No removals were needed.
   
5. **Restarted Browser**  
   Restarted Chrome to ensure no background processes from extensions remained.

6. **Researched Malicious Extension Risks**  
   Learned about potential threats such as:
   - Data theft
   - Ad injection
   - Redirecting traffic to malicious sites
   - Performance degradation
